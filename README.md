## UMP3 - A (dumb) media player

### As you probably already know, there are many media players, and they are very great

But sometimes, you just want a player thats recent, and platform compatible. For your best efforts, if you want something that <i>is not currenty a WIP,</i> use VLC.

But sometimes you want to use a newer one that's <b>still in development, and is made in the easy to maintanin QML Launguage</b>.

This is what ump3 is, it's new, unfinished, and a wip, but that's ok. With enough time, this will become a great project. So? Go on then, use it, send feedback to it, develop it with us!
